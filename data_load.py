""" Binning CTD data for spectral calculations
        This loop bins data according to the bin_size in half-overlapping segments
        descending. In order to deal with the length of the casts not matching
        and integer number of bins, the remainder of the cast length and bin size
        subtracted out and trimmed off the top. Each binned set is detrended
        before being stored. ***I'm not sure if this is the right
        way to deal with this***

        For CTD - bin size = 256 (half overlapping bins)
        --> this means 22 bins (256 points in each bin) in each cast with
        total 23 casts.
